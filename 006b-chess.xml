  <Say>Unfortunately for you, your natural judgment of your natural intelligence is not very good.  The land shark easily beats you at chess, snorting all the while at your increasing unease.  With his checkmate, he grabs your arm and pulls it to his mouth—and licks it.  "Gross," he says.  "You humans ever wash?  Well, never mind, I really don't care—you're going to be in charge of moisturizing my fin every few hours.  My skin dries out all the time out here in the desert—it's really quite unreasonable."</Say>
  <Say>As he begins waddling off, clearly expecting you to follow, you gather enough strength to ask a single question:  "Wait, you're not going to eat me?!"  He responds, not even bothering to turn around, "I'm a vegetarian, you idiot.  Way to typecast!  Just because I've got these big sharp teeth…"  His voice lowers and he continues grumbling to himself.</Say>
  <Say>You look around at the endless and empty horizon, then run after him—you may have found the only vegetarian in the desert.  Definitely the only vegetarian land shark!</Say>
  <Say>Congratulations!  You found the only bleeding heart land shark in the desert, and consequently, have not been eaten yet.</Say>
