  <Say>As you round the corner of the rock, playing along merrily, you nearly break into dance. How wonderful to find a like-minded music lover out here!</Say>

  <Say>You quickly realize that they might like music too, but that's probably all you have in common. Your horrified gaze fills out the checklist: gray pebbly skin, check. Stubby little arms, pretty hilariously short but this isn't a laughing moment, check. A rounded shape, almost all curves, check. A sharp pointy triangle located on the back, check. Big pointy sharp my-goodness-Grandma-how-big teeth, check. Evil glittery black eyes, empty of soulâ€”well, the eyes are closed, so you're not sure about that one. But all evidence points to, oh crap, a LAND SHARK.</Say>

  <Say>Should you stop playing in terror and freeze. Maybe he can't see you if you don't move. That's sharks, right? Or is that dinosaurs? A land shark seems pretty close to a dinosaur. Maybe you'll get lucky and accidentally survive this encounter.</Say><!-- 007a-friend.xml -->
