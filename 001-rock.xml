  <Say>As you stumble off, you begin playing a game that involves kicking small rocks ahead of you. Your record is 16 kicks with the same stone, but the game end abruptly when you accidentally kick a stone that is quite firmly attached to the ground.<Say>

  <Say>In your limping self pity, you don't even notice the gigantic rock formation that eases up
  on your right. Until, that is, you hear the plinkety plinkety plink of a (musical instrument)
  from behind it. Who could possibly be playing out here in the middle of nowhere?! What
  on earth should you do?!</Say>

  <Say>Whip out your harmonica and start a duet. Anyone else who appreciates the power of
  music can only be totally awesome.</Say>

  <Say>Sneak up and listen to the lyrics. Maybe they'll tell you something about the musician,
  and whether they'll be nice to you, and whether they'll have beer.</Say>

  <Say>RUN AWAY! No-one good could possibly be out here!</Say>
