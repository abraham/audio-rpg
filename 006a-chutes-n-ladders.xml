  <Say>As you two begin setting up the board, the two of you finally meet eyes. And his eyes aren't quite what you imagined land shark eyes to be. They're a soft warm brown, almost friendly.</Say>  
  <Say>His TEETH, on the other hand, wowza! They are not friendly looking in the least! When he opens his mouth to speak, that evil sharp pointy cave issues a most unexpected statement: "Chutes and Ladders is my favorite board game! I've been playing ever since I was a wee sharkling—I've even won a few tournaments in the past."</Say>  
  <Say>Dumbfounded, you just stare with your mouth wide open, probably drooling a little by mistake.</Say>  
  <Say>The land shark sighs, "Don't tell me you're going to be another one of those humans who are only good for eating! Sometimes there's just such an obvious lack of intelligence and free will that it's really just an act of mercy."</Say>  
  <Say>"No no no no no," you stutter, "That's definitely not me. I'm, um, I'm really quite smart."</Say>  
  <Say>He seems unconvinced, but luckily for you, his interest in playing Chutes and Ladders outweighs his interest in mercifully ridding the human race of dubious members. As the two of you begin playing, he grunts happily and gloats in your general direction. "Don't even think about leaving, squishy one. We're not done until I'm done. Which won't be for a very very long time…"</Say>  
  <Say>You're stuck here playing Chutes and Ladders for a while. But hey, you survived!</Say>
