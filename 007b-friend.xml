  <Say>After some time together, your eyes finally meet.  His eyes aren't quite what you imagined land shark eyes to be.  They're a soft warm brown, almost friendly.  </Say>
  <Say>His TEETH, on the other hand, wowza!  They are not friendly looking in the least!  When he opens his mouth to speak, that evil sharp pointy cave issuesâ€”an invitation for tea?!</Say>
  <Say>Well, what he really said was:  "Well, that was quite nice!"  Then he got to his stubby little feet, and continued, "I was just about to make a fire and start a cup of tea.  Would you care to join me?"     </Say>
  <Say>Dumbfounded, you just stare with your mouth wide open, probably drooling a little by mistake.  </Say>
  <Say>The land shark sighs, "Or, if you'd rather, I have a map of the desert that you can use to find your way out.  Why anyone would want to leave this place I cannot imagine, but to each his own.  And without unwitting fools stumbling around trying to get out, I'd never have anything to eat, so I should be grateful."  </Say>
  <Say>Well!  This is all unexpected!  Which offer are you going to take?</Say>
  
  <Say>Take the  map and make a run for it.</Say><!-- 008c-map.xml -->
  <Say>Stick around for the fire and tea. </Say><!-- 008a-tea.xml -->
